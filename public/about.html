<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Liam, I am (currently) a Software QA at Power HRG. I am working on web dev classes in hopes of becoming a developer at Power!</p>

<p>I have been passionate about computers and tech my entire life, learning how to use a laptop before I could walk. In HighSchool I took coding classes
  and joined my school's robotics team. This lead me to study Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State.
